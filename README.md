# CoinFlip Project

## Overview

The CoinFlip project is a decentralized application (dApp) deployed on the Optimism Sepolia testnet. It allows users to place bets on a coin flip game, with results determined by smart contracts. The application uses `@thirdweb-dev/react` for blockchain interactions, and `Context API` for state management. An admin panel is included for managing the house balance and ensuring the game runs smoothly.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Integration**: The smart contract handles the coin flip logic, betting, and result processing.
- **User Bets History**: Users can view their past bets and outcomes.
- **House Balance Management**: Admins can deposit and withdraw funds from the house balance.
- **Notifications**: Success and error notifications are provided for transactions and actions.
